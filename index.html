        <h2>Movie Trailers</h2>
        
        <p>It’s a well-established rule that if you’re going to produce a major blockbuster, then you absolutely must merchandise the hell out of it. There’s still four months until Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice hits theaters, but that doesn’t mean it’s too early for Warner Bros. to start peddling merchandise. 

T-shirts for Batman V Superman are now officially available for pre-order on Merchoid, and like much of the marketing for the film, the shirts emphasize the duality of the film.  While some of them are framed as anti-Batman propaganda, others are seemingly vandalized images of Henry Cavill’s Superman – replete with the "false god" spray paint from the initial teaser trailer. Another red shirt is available that announces the imminent showdown between the two DC greats in the same vain as a heavyweight boxing match. You can see that shirt below, to get an idea of what to expect: 

            Curabitur et ultricies quam. Aenean pretium aliquet velit, gravida vulputate urna tempus vel.  </p>
